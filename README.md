This code asks for two files:
  1. **Volume Shocker** (from: Stockedge.com)
  2. **BhavData** (from: nseindia.com)

(Keep in mind it is **BhavData** not the famous **Bhavcopy**)

It first uses the **Pandas** module to find the data:
Using the Volume Shocker File, it identifies the names of stocks and their corresponding volumes.
Then, in the BhavData file, it finds the volume% % of that stock
Then it uses **Matplotlib** to plot a stacked bar chart in dark mode

Make Sure You have:
  1. **Pandas library**
  2. **Matplotlib library**
  3. **BhavData from _nse.com_**
  4. **Volume Shockers from _stockedge.com_ (needs subscription to download)**
